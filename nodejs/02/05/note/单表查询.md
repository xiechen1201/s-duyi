# 单表查询

## SELECT 语句

```sql
-- 从 user 表中查询 id 列

SELECT id from `user`;
SELECT id,loginId,loginPwd from `user`;

-- 别名

SELECT ismale from employee;
SELECT ismale as 性别 from employee;
SELECT ismale 性别 from employee;

-- 查询所有列

SELECT * from employee;
```

## CASE & END 语句

```sql
-- case 

SELECT id,
name,
case ismale when 1 then "男" else "女" end
from employee;

SELECT id,
name,
case ismale when 1 then "男" else "女" end as 性别
from employee;

SELECT id,
name,
case when ismale = 1 then "男" else "女" end as 性别
from employee;
```

```sql
SELECT 
	id,
	name,
CASE 
	WHEN salary >= 10000 THEN "高薪" 
	WHEN salary >= 5000 THEN "中等"
	ELSE "低"
END
FROM employee;
```

## FROM 语句

## WHERE 语句

```sql
-- WHERE 对查询的结果进一步筛选
-- =
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE ismale = 1;
```

运行顺序：运行 from 得到所有数据，然后运行 where 一行一行的过滤数据，最后根据 select 得到需要的列。

```sql
-- IN 查询 companyId 在某个范围内的数据
SELECT * FROM department WHERE companyId IN (1, 2);
```

```sql
-- IS
-- 查询地址为空的数据
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE location IS NULL;
-- 查询不为空的数据
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE location IS NOT NULL;
```

```sql
-- > = <
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary >= 10000;
```

```sql
-- BRTWEEN
-- 查询xx之间的数据
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE salary BETWEEN 10000 and 12000;
```

```sql
-- LIKE
-- 做模糊查询
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE joinDate LIKE "%2008%";
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE `name` LIKE "张_";
```

```sql
-- and
-- 多个条件并列
-- 姓张 and 女生 and 薪资>=10000
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE `name` LIKE "张%" AND ismale=0 AND salary>=10000;
```

```sql
-- or
-- 多个条件并列
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE `name` LIKE "张%" AND ismale=0 AND salary>=10000 OR birthday>="1992-1-1";
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE `name` LIKE "张%" AND ismale=0 AND (salary>=10000 OR birthday>="1992-1-1");
```

## order by

```sql
-- order by
-- 用于排序
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary ASC;
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY salary DESC;
SELECT * FROM employee ORDER BY ismale ASC,salary DESC;
```

## limit

```sql
-- limit
-- 跳过n条数据，取出n条数据
SELECT * FROM employee LIMIT 2,3;
```

## distinct

通常只会查一列，不会查多列。

```sql
-- distinct
-- 查询员工分布的地址
SELECT DISTINCT location FROM employee;

-- 指的是 DISTINCT 后面所有的列都要相同才会去重
SELECT DISTINCT location,id FROM employee ORDER BY location;
```
